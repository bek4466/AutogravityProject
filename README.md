# AutogravityProject
FrontEnd

# Need to install protractor and other package libriries from node modules
Also need to transpile, I kept templ folder in there where Javascript classes are compiled
Also kept the cucumber reports with screenshots
I included Json folder where I kept some data as example of passing data parametors

Over all this project used following tech stack: Cucumber. Protractor. Typescript/Javascript and Json for data files.

Thanks
