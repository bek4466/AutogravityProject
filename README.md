# AutogravityProject
FrontEnd

# Need to install protractor and other package libriaries from node modules
Also need to transpile, I kept templ folder in there where Javascript classes are compiled
Also kept the cucumber reports with screenshots
Also kept the configs for Visual Studio IDE just in case if you planning to use it for execution of test cases.

I included Json folder where I kept some data as example of passing data parametors
I left comments inside the code for different ways of executing the test case, since there was not actual Acceptance Criteria to follow.

Over all this project used following tech stack: Cucumber. Protractor. Typescript/Javascript and Json for data files.
Let me know if you have any questions.
Thanks
